# Of Sticks & Stones

_As a skeleton I would be more careful, afterall you are indeed made of bones._

"Of Sticks & Stones" is a small puzzle game made with the Godot 4.2 Engine.\
This is my first game made with the Godot Game Engine. I learned a lot 
doing this.\
I don't know if I'll continue to develop this adding more stuff to it.
I guess only time will tell.
